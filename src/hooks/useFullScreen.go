Unfortunately, it's not possible to directly convert this React hook code to Go, as React is a JavaScript library specifically designed for building user interfaces, and Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language that is not meant for front-end development.

However, if you have a specific functionality in mind that you'd like to implement in Go, please let me know and I'd be happy to help you with that.
