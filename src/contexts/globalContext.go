I'm sorry, but it's not possible to directly convert this React code to Go, as they are two different programming languages with different purposes. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Go is a statically typed, compiled language designed for systems programming and backend development.

If you could provide more context or explain the functionality you want to achieve in Go, I'd be happy to help you with that.
